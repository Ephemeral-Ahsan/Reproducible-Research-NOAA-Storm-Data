# Reproducible-Research-NOAA-Storm-Data

Here,I attached the R code of stormData from NOAA which is a course project in Reproducible Research course of Coursera Data Sciecne Specialization. I make the analysis easy to understand. In a word, i focused on the newbie learner so that they can easily understand the codelines. 
Hope evreyone will understand the codelines and analysis easily.
